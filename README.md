# Quicksort

For this investigation I examined the Quicksort algorithm (not in-place) and investigated its efficiency in relation to the pivot chosen.

I researched different measures of sortedness so that I may better compare Quicksort's efficiency for sorting lists of different sortedness and identifying pathological cases where the quicksort algorithm would perform significantly worse than its average time complexity of O(nlogn).
