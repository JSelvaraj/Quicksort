CS2001 - Quicksort Efficiency Investigation

This is the Week 10 practical for CS2001. For this practical I had to examine the Quicksort algorithm (not in-place) and investigate its efficiency in relation to the pivot chosen.

For this practical I researched different measures of sortedness so that I may better compare Quicksort's efficiency for sorting lists of different sortedness and identifying pathological cases where the quicksort algorithm would perform significantly worse than its average time complexity of O(nlogn).
